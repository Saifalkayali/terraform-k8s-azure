# terraform-k8s-azure
#### Thisterraform-k8s-azure module is WIP - source code will be updated once I finalize and test the module successfully.
Create K8s clusters with Terraform on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). In this project I take advantage of the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) to build k8s services and configure Terraform backend.
